#IPGT Compendium
##IPGT Compendium of Test Suites for Geothermal Reservoir Modeling

This github project contains the draft of the IPGT code comparison compendium.

##Test types
The working group agreed to distinguish three different types of code tests and characterises them as:
###Bencmarks
Benchmarks are well-defined problems for which an analytical solution exists. The primary use is for code testing and code comparison.
###Test Cases
Test Cases are well-defined problems for which there is currently no analytical solution available. These are problems where the IPGT working group on reservoir modeling concluded that current established codes will converge to a solution that is likely accurate within a small range of uncertainty. The primary use is for code testing and code comparison.
###Challenge Problems
Challenge problems are more complex problems of various kinds, for none of which an analytical or established numerical solution is available.
